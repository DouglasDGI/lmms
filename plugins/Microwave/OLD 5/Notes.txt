Input Mod -> Mod Amount -> Mod Curve -> Signal -> Combination Mode -> Secondary Input Mod -> Secondary Mod Amount -> Secondary Mod Curve

Tab -> Input Mod -> Number

Input:
Main: 1-8
Sub: 1-32

Sub oscillators: Volume, Phase, Phase Randomness, Detune, Muted, Keytracking, Sample Length, Noise





Filters: Input Volume, Filter Type, Slope, Cutoff Frequency, Resonance, db Gain, Saturation, Wet/Dry, Balance (Panning), Output Volume

Make sure you add Attack and Release knobs to the mod matrix so an input follower is possible

Also allow modulation of values depending on note velocity

Remember to add tempo sync




1. Keep array(s) of changed values
2. Calculate new variable value before use
3. Use valueChanged to change the values back




$$$ 1. Clone arrays and send to bSynth initialization
$$$ 2. Send all knob changes to the same array
3. Send array changes to a vector
4. Keep track of how many notes are being played
5. Every sample, replace the values with those stored in the vector
6. After <number of notes playing> (may need to be adjusted depending on tempo and buffer size) samples pass since a knob change, remove that change record from the vector
