Now is the time to give Microwave recommendations.  As soon as I have the GUI set up, it'll get harder and harder to add new things.  **PLEASE** give your crazy ideas, even if they seem absolutely stupid, or even impossible.

Here is the list of things I have, or plan to add:
1. Main oscillator tab
- Eight possible oscillators, each with their own wavetables and knob settings.  1024 samples per waveform, 256 waveforms, but with inifinite *realtime* crossfading between waveforms
- A Morph knob to move between waveforms, and a Range knob to average together nearby waveforms
- A modify knob, with many modify modes for cool ways to morph your wavetable realtime (give me ideas for these if you have a useful/unique one)
- Up to 32 voices of unison, allowing different values of detune, phase, morph, and modify
- Phase shifting and randomization
- Knob for changing the number of samples used per waveform (not realtime unless you guys bug me enough)
- Can be modulated with any other voice, or any sound from the noise or sub oscillators, or the sample tab.
2. Step sequencing tab
- 32 drawable step sequencers that can change many values in deliciously rhythmic ways
- Length, step number, attack, decay, and humanizing knobs
3. Envelope tab
- 32 drawable envelopes that can change pretty much any value you would want to (I'll buff it to 64 if you complain enough)
- Length knob, possibly some humanizing and interpolation in the future
4. LFO tab
- Identical to Enevlope tab, except... it's an LFO...
5. Noise oscillator tab
- You can draw on the graph to change the noise flavor.  It is generated realtime in a super CPU-friendly way.  I may decide to allow modify modes to apply to this graph as well.
- I'll only have one oscillator for this unless you guys get really annoying about it.
- Comes with chocolate and vanilla plus swirl.
6. Sub oscillator tab
- I intend for Microwave to come with some delicious-sounding sub waveforms that can be loaded here.
- Any waveform can be both drawn and loaded here, regardless of whether it'll be used as a sub.
- I don't know how many of these I'll have.  I'll probably aim for eight or so.
- It's a great CPU-friendly alternative to the normal oscillatorsis when only a single waveform is required instead of a full wavetable.
7. Sample tab
- I'm not sure how many of these I'll add, it'll likely be just one unless you complain to me enough.
- Think of it as an equivalent to Serum's Noise tab, despite this not being specifically for noise.
- You may choose to either loop this or play it once per note.
- There will be a maximum length of the sound, and it will be stored within Microwave.  This is more meant for looping sounds than anything else.  If you want to play a full sample, just use AudioFileProcessor or something, haha.  It pretty much takes a sound sample and converts it into an oscillator with a very long waveform.
- I will add a single 1-knob no-click protection, so you can prevent the sample from clicking when it loops by whatever amount you choose.
8. Wavetable editing tab
- I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to impliment this.  It would be very easy to allow you to simply free draw your own waveforms and use those, but as soon as you want to use various shape drawing tools in your waveforms like Serum, things get complicated.  If there are any features for this bit that are an absolutely must-have regardless of complexity to make, please tell me.
9. Filter tab?
- I'll add this if I can figure out how to make a filter, haha.  We'll see.
10. Effects tab
- I'll only be adding effects here that would benefit (either functionally or CPU-wise) from being embedded into Microwave.  Effect ideas would be good, because while I'd like to keep most of the effect functionality in LMMS rather than Microwave specifically, putting effects inside of Microwave will allow those effects to communicate with other knobs and things in Microwave in weird, unique, and awesome ways.  If you can think of any effect ideas that would fit in that category, DEFINITELY tell me about it.
11. Misc tab
- This will have all the random options that don't fit anywhere else, including many options that will help you use Microwave with a weaker computer.  


FAQ:

Q: Is Microwave a VST, or embedded into LMMS?

A: Microwave is embedded into LMMS.  It will be 100% native, which means projects using Microwave can easily and effortlessly be sent around without any extra software.



Q: But what about the samples?  Wouldn't the other person you send the project to need the samples you loaded to be able to load that Microwave instrument?

A: Everything in Microwave, including the wavetables, the samples, oscillators, etc., will be loaded and kept in Microwave.  It is not dependent on any external files (unlike AudioFileProcessor), so no matter what you do, you should be able to send it to your parters with no extra hassle whatsoever.  And yes, this means you can save presets with them as well.



Q: Will the LMMS-native ENVs, LFOs, and filters be disabled?

A: No.  They will be fully functional.



Q: This seems like a very complicated synthesizer.  My computer is rather weak.  What do I do?

A: As one who had to suffer with a computer almost as old as me that was thrown together using various parts in my grandmother's basement, I empathize.  I have put a lot of priority into allowing this synthesizer to run as quickly as it can without igniting your computer.  There are some things that will cause CPU problems that can't be avoided (e.g. using many unison voices), but I have tried to optimize it the best I can.  I will also add some options in the Misc tab that will allow you to find the balance you need between quality and performance.  There are a few in there you may appreciate that will only cause a minor quality difference while dratically increasing performance (one example, disabling realtime crossfading between waveforms).  If you weren't blessed with a supercomputer at birth, don't worry, I got your back <3



Q: But you're... Douglas.  Aren't you supposed to... be... um...

A: Yes.  I think.  I'm just as confused as you are.



I need ideas for not only new tabs, but also new features for the individual tabs.  DO NOT think that you will be giving me a burden by giving me your ideas.  Rather, you would be improving the synthesizer for the hundreds of thousands of people who will use it in the future of LMMS.  Please tell me absolutely every idea for it that you have that you think would be beneficial and worth adding, even if it seems stupid, and especially if it seems impossible.  It is oftentimes quite difficult to tell the difference between things that are impossible and things that haven't been done yet.
As the heart and soul of this synthesizer is in the main oscillator tab with the wavetables and such, that is what I will be focusing the most on, *BUT* do not let that keep you from giving feedback for the other areas in the slightest.

Thank you <3
