Use "++i" instead of "i++".  1% boost for integers.
Use "+=" instead of "+" for strings (23% boost), but use "+" instead of "+=" for integers (otherwise shrinks to 93% speed).
Prefer initialization over assignment.  4% boost for integers.














`if( __builtin_expect( variable, expected value ) )` will increase performance if "expected value" is the right value, and will otherwise decrease performance slightly.
